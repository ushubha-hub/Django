# Django

Django is an extremely popular and fully featured server-side web framework, which is written in Python. Django is a free and open-source web application framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.

If you want to become a web developer, then this tutorial will surely help you. Along with learning the basics of Django, we will also create two real-world projects using the Django web framework. In the first project, we will learn to create an end to end website with contact form and in the second project, we will create the website using an authentication system in which the user can log in and logout. This website will also handle how to authenticate the user or how to add a user. With the help of the project, you will learn how to use the built-in authentication system of Django. For this project, we are going to use the Virtual Studio Code IDE.
